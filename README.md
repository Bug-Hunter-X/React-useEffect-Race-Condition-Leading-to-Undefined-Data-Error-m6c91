This repository demonstrates a common race condition bug in React applications. The `bug.js` file contains a component that fetches data using `useEffect`.  The component attempts to render the data before it's fetched, leading to an error because `.map()` is called on `undefined`. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution using the optional chaining operator and a conditional rendering to prevent the error.  This showcases a best practice for handling asynchronous operations in React components.
